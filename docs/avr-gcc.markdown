This firmware **REQUIRES** avr-gcc 4.6.2 or 4.6.3. Higher Versions are untested except:
It will build with avr-gcc 4.9.4 (with avr-libc 1.8.1). Also using 6.3, 6.5 and 8.2 (with avr-libc 2.0.0)
It will **NOT** function correctly when built with avr-gcc 4.5.x.  You are strongly encouraged to use either avr-gcc 4.6.2 & avr-libc 1.7.2 or avr-gcc 4.6.3 and avr-libc-1.8.1.

A short introduction in getting up and running with ubuntu 18.04 can be found in the readme in dist/build-avr-gcc
It might also work with older releases, but is not tested.

For other directions on obtaining and building avr-gcc, please see

Below was a invaluable inspiration. Nevertheless it is heavily outdated. (and the VM is VirtualBox and uses Vagrant)
* [https://github.com/dcnewman/Ubuntu-Sailfish-VM](https://github.com/dcnewman/Ubuntu-Sailfish-VM)
which is a repository containing the necessary source files to build a complete
avr-gcc 4.6.3 toolchain.  It also contains links to to pre-built Ubuntu virtual
machines with the toolchain built and installed to `/usr`.

Below is NOT VALID for the Ubuntu script:
*  The shell scripts in the `dist/build-avr-gcc/` subdirectory of this repository for
suggestions on how to build a toolchain.  The links in those scripts may no longer
point at available downloads.  The gcc maintainers eventually remove older tool chains
from their repository thus invalidating the links.

for general directions on build gcc toolchains.
